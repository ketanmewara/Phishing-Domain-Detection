Phishing is a type of fraud where an attacker pretends to be someone or something they're not, such as a company or person, in order to get sensitive information. It can be done by email and other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it's easier to trick people into clicking a link that looks like it's from a legitimate source to access to a computer's protections. The main goal is to identify or predict whether the domain is real or malicious.
